# forecast_consumer_spending_GT
Python codes I wrote for my thesis about forecasting UK consumer spending on fine-grained categories of goods, using Google Trends.

All along, I used the expression "macroeconomic variables", even though there was the Consumer Confidence Index, a survey-based indicator, because 5 out of the 6 traditional variables used were macroeconomic variables.
